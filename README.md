# Robotics Toolboxi Project
This Robotics Toolbox offers an easy to plug robotics algorithms into a simulation environment.

## Models
The following models are currently available for the simulation:
* Simple car/bicycle model
* Differential Drive
* Extended Bicycle Kinematic model

## Solvers
The following solvers are currently available for the simulation:
* Euler solver
* Runge Kutta 4th Order

## Todos
* Simulation (Environement, Static Obstacles, Dynamical Obstacles)
* Controllers (PID, LQR, MPC, IT-MPC)
* Filters (Histogram, Particle, Kalman)
* Planners (RRT*, A*, PRM)
* SLAM (Graph SLAM, Online Graph SLAM)
* Unitytest
